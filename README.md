**Abstract:**

This visualization focuses on income quintile trends in Sub-Saharan Africa. It starts with a broad visual of change within quintiles for all countries, and then navigates to Ghana, Burkina Faso and Tanzania. These three countries were chosen to represent three different types of inequality trends on the African continent: Ghana shows rising inequality, Burkina Faso falling, and Tanzania an inverted u-shaped ∩ inequality trend.

In the opening segment, income quintiles are illustrated by a single positive/negative bar chart sorted by amount of change. The user can hover over the chart to expand and read details on mouseover.

In the three country section, income quintiles are illustrated by two charts: a stacked bar chart to represent change in proportion of each country’s total income, and a positive/negative bar chart to illustrate percentage change. Text is generated from the data as the user interacts with the graphs.

The World Development Indicators data used for this visualization is incomplete, so starting and ending years are different for each country. This created a challenge when trying to design a comparative visualization.

This was coded in D3.js by Rye Zupancis with the incorporation of Mike Bostock’s templates listed below.
