Wouldn’t true machine learning move beyond human input?

Machine learning training content is the problem

Comparing some of these examples before and after machine decision making


This human urge to move beyond human imperfection and how difficult, if not impossible that is. To move beyond human imperfection as a whole do we need something completely and scarily lacking in humanity?

Human history is a struggle to automate in order to free up time - creating problems of 1. survival 2.efficiency
